# YTDownloader
YouTube Video Downloader
You must first install pytube by using the following command: "pip3 install pytube"
This simple python code takes a YouTube link as an argument and prints out the title and views. 
The code then starts downloading the video in highest resolution to a given directory in the system.
You must enter a valid directory path on line 12 of the code to allow the video to be downloaded.

To run the code in terminal you must make sure that you are in the correct directory of which you downloaded the .py file "C:\Users\...".
Once that is taken care of, enter the following command:
python YTdownload.py "paste url here with double quotes"
